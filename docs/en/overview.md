# Project overview

The UAH Marketing Lab interactive applications cycle includes between 10 and 15 web tools designed to support teaching in marketing courses: strategic marketing, consumer behaviour, brand management, digital marketing, services marketing and international marketing.

Each application acts as a mini-lab with simulated or real data, visualisations and exportable reports.
